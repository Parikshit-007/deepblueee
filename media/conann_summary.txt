 Conan O'Brien will speak at Harvard's first online graduation. The comedian has only 10 minutes to speak instead of the traditional 20. He promises to do his best since everyone's in such a big hurry to get back to doing nothing.
 You are witnessing many many firsts in today's ceremony. For example, normally graduates would greet and shake hands with their faculty deans. But now that shaking hands is a classy felony, those faculty members decided instead to give you a virtual butt bump on TikTok. In another first, this year Harvard has discarded traditional grading and switched to a pass fail system. And finally, for the first time, all of you will receive your diplomas by mail.
 You have been handed two choices. Use the trial of this global pandemic as the inspirational launching pad to a greater destiny, or two, go to Trump Rout and blame all your problems on the previous graduating class. I realize I've said many foolish things to you today. But I would like to be sincere. I'll see you guys tonight at Applebees! Get those onion rings! So do not despair this online ceremony, but celebrate it.
 As the father of two teenage children, immediately. Get your stuff, get out. Something no one has said to me since my first marriage. And since that day you have found ways to stay safe under absurd and confusing circumstances. And one way or the other, your hard-won resilience has gotten you here today to your TV or phone or tablet or smartwatch.
