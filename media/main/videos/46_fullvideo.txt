Have you ever realized how stressful it is for a newbie codeur to keep up with all the tech updates, regular profile building and enhancement, your publishing research papers and serving equally dedicated to their coding journey. And I think that in your students are a life example. Now, as we understand this problem, we need to find a solution, right? That's exactly how EID showed up. EID is a user-friendly online software development platform that conjoints developers all around the globe together to create work published their projects together as a single entity. EID adapts the principle of more heads are better than one. Superior quality of content is therefore achieved because of the involvement of a large cloud of ideas, And I think that in your students are a life example.

EID is a user-friendly online software development platform that conjoints developers all around the globe together to create work published their projects together as a single entity. EID adapts the principle of more heads are better than one. Superior quality of content is therefore achieved because of the involvement of a large cloud of ideas, skills and participation, with numerous people often their best ideas, skills and support, one can only expect quality results. Now, for our idea, we have to check upon the roots of our idea. We have discussed it with some of the industry experts, such as Foreign Shah is an assistant professor at the Taco College of Engineering and Hira Villal, who is the co-founder of the D.Web Box Company who have held their guidance for this idea. So, beginning with the idea expansion, skills and participation, with numerous people often their best ideas, skills and support, one can only expect quality results. Now, for our idea, we have to check upon the roots of our idea. We have discussed it with some of the industry experts, such as Foreign Shah is an assistant professor at the Taco College of Engineering and Hira Villal, who is the co-founder of the D.Web Box Company who have held their guidance for this idea. So, beginning with the idea expansion, let's have a look through the idea of literature. With an increase in the number of problem statements each year, the need and requirement for multiple distinctive open source development platforms have grown significantly. Many online ideas support computer programming. Now, with this, the developers have to choose the best online idea to keep competitive learning and technical awareness. In this case, the best choice is an online idea that can develop and easily use and support necessary libraries, even though it is assessed for free. let's have a look through the idea of literature.

We have a clear objective. We do have this idea on some clear objectives. In fact, we have divided them into four times. The first one is motivation. We want to motivate new people into the field of development and motivate those who are already in it to work together as a team. Because teamwork makes a dream work. The next section is about being unique. We want to do something that others might have just dreamt used. It also judges code, efficiency, and highlighting quality to their own teamers.

The next section is about being unique. We want to do something that others might have just dreamt to do. But it is the only thing that has been done until now. A totally dedicated work space for your research. This work space will support your idea right from the inception, right of the public's population. And to remind you, nothing like this has been done until now. As a tree cannot grow without seeds for a diamond. So do we have to stop something in order to grow? The first one being the excuses of not having proper hardware and software. We would also have to stop the tedious process of resume building and instead have a dynamically updated resume with 10,000 minutes. But the most important thing is that we don't have to stop to do.

We would also have to stop the tedious process of resume building minutes. But the most important thing is that we don't have to stop the resume building and instead have a dynamically updated resume with all your statistics combined at one single place. And finally progress cannot come without change. So your are few changes. The first one you would like to change the method in which project some years by letting people work together and that too on the exact same page in real time. And the next thing which you would like to change is the platform. As our platform not only supports all that I just said, it supports all of them all at one single place. the resume building and instead have a dynamically updated resume with all your statistics combined at one single place.

Resource planning relies heavily on the accurate estimation of the time and budget at the start of the project and prioritization skills of a project manager. But to take a lump sum estimation, the resources that is the hardware and the software that would be needed for the implementation of our idea is for the front it we are going to use HTML CSS bootstrap react angular. For the backend we need AWS that is called service express node Resource planning relies heavily on the accurate estimation of the time and budget at the start of the project and prioritization skills of a project manager. But to take a lump sum estimation, the resources that is the hardware and the software that would be needed for the implementation of our idea is for the front it we are going to use HTML CSS bootstrap react angular. For the backend we need AWS that is called service express node and for the servers we are going to need four different servers one for backup, one for security and for primary and secondary servers respectively. We may switch on to the resources as we are still in the planning phase. Success is preparation, opportunity and hard work come together. We have the opportunity and you are willing to do the work. All we need is to prepare and we have gone through many resources on the internet to prepare a timeline on which we should create a project. and for the servers we are going to need four different servers one for backup, one for security and for primary and secondary servers respectively.

All we need is to prepare and we have gone through many resources on the internet to prepare a timeline on which we should create a project. Now the first thing would be brainstorming. Our project being big, we need to plan for it properly to estimate all the resources. We have taken advice from your industry exports. We need to build a team and to track and manage that team and all the resources that they would need and to also estimate the cost for its implementation. The second one, development planning. The team that we have should interact between each other. There should be divisions made based on their specialties. We do assign a team lead among them and train and that team lead should train all Now the first thing would be brainstorming.

The team that we have should interact between each other. There should be divisions made based on their specialties. We do assign a team lead among them and train and that team lead should train all the juniors and at the same time they should be a compliance check for the senior developers as well. So that the workflow goes smoothly. The third one would be the website and UI design. Now nothing works well if it doesn't look good and that's where we need content on our website. Now content creation would be one of the most important parts in our website and UI design. After that you would have a website design along with its UI and UX being such a level that even big numbers are able to use it and at the same time it doesn't go to the advanced users. the juniors and at the same time they should be a compliance check for the senior developers as well.

The fourth one website development. As soon as the user enters our platform the first thing you will see is the front end and that's why that should look awesome. Now along with the front end there should be a good backend, data based, its design and creation and they all should be linked in such a way that it takes the least amount of time between any interaction and all the users needs are met quickly. The next is alpha testing and better testing. Now alpha testing is a part where the developers of the company tell other developers The fourth one website development. As soon as the user enters our platform the first thing you will see is the front end and that's why that should look awesome. Now along with the front end there should be a good backend, data based, its design and creation and they all should be linked in such a way that it takes the least amount of time between any interaction and all the users needs are met quickly. The next is alpha testing and better testing. Now alpha testing is a part where the developers of the company tell other developers within the same company to test their software. Now this leads to a few bugs coming out but not all because humans take mistakes and developers are also human. And that's where we have a better version. A better version helps external users play along with our code, experiment with it and also it gives us a chance as where to experiment with the new features you would come up with in the future. And the last one would be launching and deployment. Now launching might seem like a small file word, a small letter word in normal English within the same company to test their software.

And the last one would be launching and deployment. Now launching might seem like a small file word, a small letter word in normal English but if launching isn't done right, even the best of projects will fail. And that's why our launch should be the best and for that we will need the developers, testers, team leaders, creators, the entire committee to prepare all the resources, the servers, the hostels, the front end, the backend, etc. So that our launch would be one of the best ones. It should actually be a head 10, a her turn off so that all the people are attracted towards the platforms. but if launching isn't done right, even the best of projects will fail.

Creating software is a cost-eating time-consuming process. And it's so common that it can be very easy to go over budget, actually desire timeline or encounter other results. We will be doing investment-based and fast sectors. Human resources that includes building a team, adding developers from different fields to work for EID. Technical experts will be needed to train developers and manage their respective work. Cost implementation planning is an important aspect of software development.

Technical experts will be needed to train developers and manage their respective work. Training programs will be held and team-building activities for efficient working. Secondly, we will basically need four types of software, security, backup, primary and secondary. Measure costs will be needed for different tools, software, ID, cloud services and industry experts. We also need a workspace for our team, come together to work on an Internet facilities and other equipment for smooth function.

If the user has chosen login, he will be directly redirected to his homepage by verifying his password and username. Once on the homepage, the user will have various options for the menus such as Dynamic Profile, CoD editor, repositories, and other tools. The first menu, which is profile, the profile will be set up by the user during the sign up process. After the sign up process, the profile will dynamically change using the AR, which will keep tabs on their achievements and projects stored in the repository, which they complete throughout their journey. The second menu item is a code editor that supports multiple languages and has a real time compiling capabilities. So, the coder can compile the code easily without any hassle and downloading external software. The first menu, which is profile, the profile will be set up by the user during the sign up process.
