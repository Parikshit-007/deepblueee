 Conan O'Brien speaks at Harvard's first online graduation. He promises to do his best since everyone's in such a big hurry to get back to doing absolutely nothing. He says Harvard has been graduating students for nearly 400 years.
 As you sit here today, or stand, or microwave a burrito, or write a peloton, or climb uncomfortably in your childhood bed, or mine, Bitcoin, or Google, Who is Conan O'Brien? You are witnessing many, many firsts in today's ceremony. For example, normally graduates would greet and shake hands with their faculty deans. Now that shaking hands is a Class D felony, those faculty members decided instead to give you a virtual butt bump on TikTok.
 To those of you who moved back home to a red state, I'll see you guys tonight at Applebee's. So do not despair this online ceremony, but celebrate it. You have been handed two choices. Use the trial of this global pandemic as the inspirational launching pad to a greater destiny, or two, go to Trump route and blame all your problems on the previous graduating class.
 Ten weeks ago you were told to leave your dorms immediately. Get your stuff, get out. Something no one has said to me since my first marriage. And since that day you have found ways to stay safe under absurd and confusing circumstances. And one way or the other, your hard one resilience has gotten you here today to your TV or phone or tablet or smart watch to graduate from Harvard. As the father of two teenage children, I look at all you've achieved in a frightful world and it gives me great hope.
