 Conan O'Brien speaks at Harvard's first online graduation. He promises to do his best since everyone's in such a big hurry to get back to doing absolutely nothing. He says the administration has given him only 10 minutes to speak.
 Conan O'Brien: As you sit here today, or stand, or microwave a burrito, or write a peloton, or recline uncomfortably in your childhood bed, or mine bitcoin, or a Google. You are witnessing many, many firsts in today's ceremony. For example, normally, graduates would greet and shake hands with their faculty deans. But now that shaking hands is a Class D felony, those faculty members decided instead to give you a virtual butt bump on TikTok. And by the way, congratulations to the department heads. You really captured what Cotton Mather was all about.
 To those of you who moved back home to a red state, I'll see you guys tonight at Applebee's. So do not despair this online ceremony, but celebrate it. You have been handed two choices. Use the trial of this global pandemic as the inspirational launching pad to a greater destiny or two.
 Ten weeks ago you were told to leave your dorms immediately. Get your stuff, get out. Something no one has said to me since my first marriage. And since that day you have found ways to stay safe under absurd and confusing circumstances. And one way or the other, your hard one resilience has gotten you here today to your TV or phone or tablet or smartwatch to graduate from Harvard. As the father of two teenage children, I look at all you've achieved in a frightful world and it gives me great hope.
