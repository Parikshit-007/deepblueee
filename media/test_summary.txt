 Conan O'Brien speaks at Harvard's first online graduation. He says he is truly, truly honored to receive an honorary degree from Harvard College. He promises to do his best since everyone's in such a big hurry to get back to doing nothing.
 Conan O'Brien: As you sit here today, or stand, or microwave a burrito, or write a peloton, or recline uncomfortably in your childhood bed, or mine bitcoin, or a Google. You are witnessing many, many firsts in today's ceremony. For example, normally, graduates would greet and shake hands with their faculty deans. But now that shaking hands is a Class D felony, those faculty members decided instead to give you a virtual butt bump on TikTok. In another first, this year Harvard has discarded traditional grading and switched to a pass fail system.
 To those of you who moved back home to a red state, I'll see you guys tonight at Applebee's. To those onion rings. So do not despair this online ceremony, but celebrate it. Use the trial of this global pandemic as the inspirational launching pad to a greater destiny or two. Go to Trump route and blame all your problems on the previous graduating class. If nothing else, just make that a T-shirt.
 Ten weeks ago you were told to leave your dorms immediately. Get your stuff, get out. Something no one has said to me since my first marriage. And since that day you have found ways to stay safe under absurd and confusing circumstances. And one way or the other, your hard one resilience has gotten you here today to your TV or phone or tablet or smartwatch to graduate from Harvard. As the father of two teenage children, I look at all you've achieved in a frightful world.
